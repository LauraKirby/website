PARTIALS
You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A partial is simply a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like _partial.scss. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the @import directive.

Sass builds on top of the current CSS @import and will take the file that you want to import and combine it with the file you're importing into so you can serve a single CSS file to the web browser. (Eliminating an extra http call.)


The new main syntax (as of Sass 3) is known as “SCSS”

You may now add and edit sass stylesheets in the sass subdirectory of your project.

ass files beginning with an underscore are called partials and won't be
compiled to CSS, but they can be imported into other sass stylesheets.

You can configure your project by editing the config.rb configuration file.

You must compile your sass stylesheets into CSS when they change.
This can be done in one of the following ways:
  1. To compile on demand:
     compass compile [path/to/project]
  2. To monitor your project for changes and automatically recompile:
     compass watch [path/to/project]

To import your new stylesheets add the following lines of HTML (or equivalent) to your webpage:
<head>
  <link href="/stylesheets/screen.css" media="screen, projection" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
  <link href="/stylesheets/print.css" media="print" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
  <!--[if IE]>
      <link href="/stylesheets/ie.css" media="screen, projection" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
  <![endif]-->
</head>
