Questions: 

make a Typhoeus request. add Typhoeus to project, cdn? Typheous is used with Rails.

cannot make ajax request to xml, bc of same origin. to fix this, would need to create a backend.

you can obtain the xml through jsonp. jsonp was the solution before cors came along. you will use a script tag, just like have we use cdn's in a script tag.
