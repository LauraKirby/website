<p>	Singleton classes, not to be confused with the singleton design pattern, refers to adding methods to only one instance of a class. </p><p>	Huh? </p><p>	Ruby allows you to explicitly specify a receiver when defining methods. Thus, you can add a method to one object instance of a class. The syntax is similar to what is used when creating class methods. However, we&rsquo;re adding a method to the object. </p><p>	Upon adding a method to an object Ruby inserts a new anonymous class into the inheritance hierarchy as a container to hold these new methods. A singleton class does not have a name, therefore it is anonymous. A new object cannot be instantiated from a singleton class. </p><p>	New instances of your original class, before you created the singleton class, will not have the anonymous singleton class, and thus will not have access to its methods. </p>
